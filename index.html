				<h2><u>About Us</u></h2>
					<p>Welcome to DreamDrive.com! An online showroom for buying pre-owned cars.</p>
				
					<p>As of 2018 we are a relatively new company which is only an year old but having promising sales every single day. We are known for our quality of service and keeping our customers happy with the value added services we provide. We dont always have all the models from different vendors, but only the one's people want to sell. So if you're looking for a specific model, we can work towards adding the model to our list.</p>
				
					<p>We only sell second hand cars which satisfy the following conditions:
						
	<!-- Use of ordered lists to show the conditions for the new cars-->
						<ol>
							<li>The car should be of the most recent models. [Ex. In 2018, we sell 2016-2018 models only]</li>
							<li>The cars should totally be driven less than 30,000Km.</li>
							<li>The cars are in good shape internally and externally.</li>
							<li>The car at the time of arranging will be registered to someone who is the primary owner of the car. We don't buy cars from secondary owners.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
